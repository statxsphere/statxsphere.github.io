            <h2>Hi, there!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! </p>
            <p>I'm a data scientist with 5+ years of experience across various domains. Focused on creativity, collaboration, and effective communication, I approach problems with a solution-first mentality. </p> 
            <p>I would love for you to check out the following pages to get to know me better:</p>

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My data journey started with sports. As someone who was blown away by moments of magic created in various arenas as a kid, teenager, and even as an adult, I soon realised that I had a strong desire to be involved in this industry. Being struck by this realisation during my college days drove me to find my first internship in 2018. To this day, I am grateful to my time there, for not only helping me understand how sports businesses function but also for getting me hooked on the world of data science.</p>
            <p>With minimal experience, maximal ambition, and perhaps a small nudge from being an MBA student, I co-founded my own sports analytics firm in 2019 as I believed that there were gaps that could be bridged in the sports analytics landscape in India. With a dream to take India to the FIFA World Cup fueling us, we were able to kick things off and run smoothly despite being a bootstrap venture. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to shut down as it is hard to analyze sports when no sports are being played. This was a very challenging time for me, but also a period of exponential growth where I channelled the shortcomings I faced and levelled up my skills to match my ambition and passion.</p>
            <p>The impact of the pandemic ran deeper than just my skillset, however, as it ilicited within me a feeling of dread regarding climate change as another looming threat to civilization as we know it. Since 2021, I have actively and intentionally postioned myself as a stakeholder in the climate tech space, with a special focus on solar energy technology and carbon emissions monitoring as these are the domains where my interests and potential for impact intersect the most.</p>
            <p>Today I see myself as a data and product professional vying for growth in role and responsibility, to be able to engage with stakeholders and affect change in order to leave the world a better place when I go out than when I came in. I hope we're able to help each other do the same. Cheers!</p>
